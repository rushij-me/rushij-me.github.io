    <h1 class="center">Some Words and Some Pictures</h1>
    <p>
        I have created following Thumbnails with 3 distinct goals:
    <ol>
        <li> Fit in with the channels look and feel </li>
        <li> Must use content from the video (No Clickbait) </li>
        <li> Be Intriguing i.e clickable (Hopefully) </li>
    </ol>
    <span class="grey">
        PS: There's more at the end of the page, but first lets get to the thumbnails.</span>

    <p>I have a theory @1:24 kind of fits with this still from @7:55</p>

    <p>Turned up exposure a bit for visibility</p>

    <p>Still from the video @12:46, More of a happy and sobering vibe, celebrating 1 million.</p>
    <img src="./images/o2/i1.png" alt="">

    <div class="sp"></div>
    <p>"What the hell is wrong with you?" from @0:56 fits with this still from @12:40 a little too well. going with a more cheeky, fun vibe for this one. </p>

        About the requirements
        <ol>
            <li>I would consider myself reasonably fluent in English.</li>
            <li>I will be more than willing for the feedback and will be highly motivated to work with you.</li>
            <li>I do not however use photoshop, partly because I can't afford the software and partly because my machine can't run it very well.</li>
            <li>I am still proficient with GIMP and Inkscape, which are free and lightweight alternatives to Photoshop and Illustrator while being just as capable.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="grey">
            Also I have been following your channel for more than 2 years now, and do understand and love the general tone and feel of the videos. I believe I can add value to your channel while learning some stuff from you too.
            If you like this work great, if you don't I would still love to get some feedback from you. Hope you like this submission, wishing you the best of luck, RJ.
